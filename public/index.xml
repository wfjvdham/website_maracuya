      <description>When scraping data from an internet page it is commun that it is not nicely formatted in table kind of way. To me it happens a lot that you get a list of lists and that the second layer of lists have different lengths. To convert this kind of data can be tricky so I made an example here. It is a shiny application that reads data from the eredivisie beach site and uses it to culculate the current standings for the wildcards for the EC.</description>

      <title>Animations in Shiny using TweenLite</title>

      <description>From a colleague I heard about TweenLite, a JavaScript library that can be used to animate objects on your website. You can move elements around by controlling their speed and position. I wanted to see how well this would work in a Shiny application so I experimented a little bit with that.
The result is an application that can keep track of the score of the the weakest link, a TV game show from more than 10 years ago.</description>

      <description>Last December I had the opportunity to work with my friends from randommonkey. We made special about the Colombian kitchen. Part of this special was a Shiny application that can be used to search trough the Colombian recipes. Names, ingredient, region, complexity and the time required can be used to find your favorite one. After finding a recipe you can download the description.
So if you are interested in making some Mojarras fritas (and you know a little Spanish because the page is completely in Spanish) look here.</description>

      <description>This is a maracuya…
…my favorite Colombian fruit.
 But Maracuya IT is my company for giving classes about R. I offer four courses at the moment:
R - Basics, for people who have zero or little experience with R. The basic about how to explore data, create graphics, do some simple statistical models and present the results is explained. The tidyverse packages are used for this. R - Machine Learning, this course focuses on using more complex statistical models in R.</description>
