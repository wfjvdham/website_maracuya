      <description>Last December I had the opportunity to work with my friends from randommonkey. We made special about the Colombian kitchen. Part of this special was a Shiny application that can be used to search trough the Colombian recipes. Names, ingredient, region, complexity and the time required can be used to find your favorite one. After finding a recipe you can download the description.
So if you are interested in making some Mojarras fritas (and you know a little Spanish because the page is completely in Spanish) look here.</description>

      <description>This is a maracuya…
…my favorite Colombian fruit.
 But Maracuya IT is my company for giving classes about R. I offer four courses at the moment:
R - Basics, for people who have zero or little experience with R. The basic about how to explore data, create graphics, do some simple statistical models and present the results is explained. The tidyverse packages are used for this. R - Machine Learning, this course focuses on using more complex statistical models in R.</description>
