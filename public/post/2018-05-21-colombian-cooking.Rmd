Last December I had the opportunity to work with my friends from [randommonkey](https://www.datasketch.co). We made special about the [Colombian kitchen](http://especiales.datasketch.co/cocina-colombiana/). Part of this special was a Shiny application that can be used to search trough the Colombian recipes. Names, ingredient, region, complexity and the time required can be used to find your favorite one. After finding a recipe you can download the description.

So if you are interested in making some _Mojarras fritas_ (and you know a little Spanish because the page is completely in Spanish) look [here](http://especiales.datasketch.co/cocina-colombiana/recetas-colombianas.html).

The code of the application can be found [here](https://github.com/wfjvdham/cocina-colombiana)
