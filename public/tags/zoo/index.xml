      <description>For a long time I have been using the 7 minute workout app. Every time you finish a workout the app shows you how many workouts you did for the last 30 days. This is nice but it does not tell you how it relates to anything you did before the last 30 days. So around a year ago I decided to start storing the dates with this number. Now I can make a graph that shows me how often I did my exercises in the last 30 days and the average for the last year.</description>
