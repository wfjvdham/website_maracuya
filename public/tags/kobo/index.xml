      <description>When reading interesting books on my Kobo reader, I like to mark some parts of the text. Using those notes later can be difficult because they are stored on your Kobo in a *.annot file. To convert them to a readable *.txt file I made a shiny app. After converting you can you the result online and download it if you want. The code can be found here.
Uploading a File In shiny you can upload a file using the fileInput() function, that creates an upload control element that can be used to upload files.</description>
