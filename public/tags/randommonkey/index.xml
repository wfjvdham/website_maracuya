      <description>In the Netherlands we have the StemWijzer a tool that calculates for which person to vote depending on your position on some statements. In Colombia they did not have such a tool yet. So I decided to make a template application which can work for any country. The only thing you need is a list of statements where you can agree with or not. And a list of persons of which you know their positions on those statements.</description>

      <description>Last December I had the opportunity to work with my friends from randommonkey. We made special about the Colombian kitchen. Part of this special was a Shiny application that can be used to search trough the Colombian recipes. Names, ingredient, region, complexity and the time required can be used to find your favorite one. After finding a recipe you can download the description.
So if you are interested in making some Mojarras fritas (and you know a little Spanish because the page is completely in Spanish) look here.</description>
