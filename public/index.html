        This is a maracuya…
…my favorite Colombian fruit.
 In 2016 I moved to Colombia where I learned to speak spanish, to dance bachata, how to make arepas and how to make a jugo de maracuya.
I also started giving classes about the R language, which I really enjoyed. Back in the Netherlands I continued giving the classes and extended the topics to other languages like python and JavaScript.

        For a long time I have been using the 7 minute workout app. Every time you finish a workout the app shows you how many workouts you did for the last 30 days. This is nice but it does not tell you how it relates to anything you did before the last 30 days. So around a year ago I decided to start storing the dates with this number. Now I can make a graph that shows me how often I did my exercises in the last 30 days and the average for the last year.

        <span class="post-date">Jun 18, 2018</span>
        When reading interesting books on my Kobo reader, I like to mark some parts of the text. Using those notes later can be difficult because they are stored on your Kobo in a *.annot file. To convert them to a readable *.txt file I made a shiny app. After converting you can you the result on-line and download it if you want. The code can be found here.
Uploading a File In shiny you can upload a file using the fileInput() function, that creates an upload control element that can be used to upload files.

        Riddles.io is a platform were you can practice your AI skills. You can compete with other groups or persons on different challenges. For all those challenges you have to program an agent or bot that takes actions depending on what your opponents do. One of those challenges is about playing the game of ultimate tic tac toe. This a more complex, and more interesting, version of the classical tic tac toe.

        <span class="post-date">Jun 14, 2018</span>
        In the Netherlands we have the StemWijzer a tool that calculates for which person to vote depending on your position on some statements. In Colombia they did not have such a tool yet. So I decided to make a template application which can work for any country. The only thing you need is a list of statements where you can agree with or not. And a list of persons of which you know their positions on those statements.

        NOTE The example is not working anymore because the website is down.
When scraping data from an internet page it is commun that it is not nicely formatted in table kind of way. To me it happens a lot that you get a list of lists and that the second layer of lists have different lengths. To convert this kind of data can be tricky so I made an example here.

        From a colleague I heard about TweenLite, a JavaScript library that can be used to animate objects on your website. You can move elements around by controlling their speed and position. I wanted to see how well this would work in a Shiny application so I experimented a little bit with that.
The result is an application that can keep track of the score of the the weakest link, a TV game show from more than 10 years ago.

        Last December I had the opportunity to work with my friends from randommonkey. We made special about the Colombian kitchen. Part of this special was a Shiny application that can be used to search trough the Colombian recipes. Names, ingredient, region, complexity and the time required can be used to find your favorite one. After finding a recipe you can download the description.
So if you are interested in making some Mojarras fritas (and you know a little Spanish because the page is completely in Spanish) look here.
