        This is a maracuya…
…my favorite Colombian fruit.
 But Maracuya IT is my company for giving courses about R. I offer four courses at the moment:
 Basics starting point if you have few or zero experience with R. The basic concepts are explained here.  Introduction about me, R and this course Exploring data using the ggplot2 and dplyr packages Presenting results using the rmarkdown package More exercises about exploring data Transforming data to a tidy format using the tidy package Make calculations with times and dates using the lubridate package Reading data from a file into R using the readr package, or connect to a database using the DBI package An introduction into statistical models Making a simple linear model Making a simple logistic regression model   ML here more advanced techniques for modeling a dataset are explained  Explanation of re sampling techniques like cross validation and bootstrapping Automatic feature selection Decision trees and random forests More examples for modeling and the Simpson’s paradox   Big Data explanation of what is big data, hadoop and spark and how to use it in combination with R  Introduction to Big Data Introduction to Hadoop, MapReduce ans Spark Introduction to the sparklyr package Introduction to Cloudera   Advanced here more advanced R topics are explained  Functional programming using the purrr package Making interactive web pages using shiny Using asynchronous programming in a shiny application Scraping information from an internet page using the rvest package  This website will contain examples of what you can do with the knowledge obtained in these courses.

        <span class="post-date">Jun 18, 2018</span>
        When reading interesting books on my Kobo reader, I like to mark some parts of the text. Using those notes later can be difficult because they are stored on your Kobo in a *.annot file. To convert them to a readable *.txt file I made a shiny app. After converting you can you the result on-line and download it if you want. The code can be found here.
Uploading a File In shiny you can upload a file using the fileInput() function, that creates an upload control element that can be used to upload files.

        Riddles.io is a platform were you can practice your AI skills. You can compete with other groups or persons on different challenges. For all those challenges you have to program an agent or bot that takes actions depending on what your opponents do. One of those challenges is about playing the game of ultimate tic tac toe. This a more complex, and more interesting, version of the classical tic tac toe.

        <span class="post-date">Jun 14, 2018</span>
        In the Netherlands we have the StemWijzer a tool that calculates for which person to vote depending on your position on some statements. In Colombia they did not have such a tool yet. So I decided to make a template application which can work for any country. The only thing you need is a list of statements where you can agree with or not. And a list of persons of which you know their positions on those statements.

        <span class="post-date">Jun 12, 2018</span>
        When scraping data from an internet page it is commun that it is not nicely formatted in table kind of way. To me it happens a lot that you get a list of lists and that the second layer of lists have different lengths. To convert this kind of data can be tricky so I made an example here. It is a shiny application that reads data from the eredivisie beach site and uses it to culculate the current standings for the wildcards for the EC.

        <span class="post-date">Jun 8, 2018</span>
        From a colleague I heard about TweenLite, a JavaScript library that can be used to animate objects on your website. You can move elements around by controlling their speed and position. I wanted to see how well this would work in a Shiny application so I experimented a little bit with that.
The result is an application that can keep track of the score of the the weakest link, a TV game show from more than 10 years ago.

        Last December I had the opportunity to work with my friends from randommonkey. We made special about the Colombian kitchen. Part of this special was a Shiny application that can be used to search trough the Colombian recipes. Names, ingredient, region, complexity and the time required can be used to find your favorite one. After finding a recipe you can download the description.
So if you are interested in making some Mojarras fritas (and you know a little Spanish because the page is completely in Spanish) look here.
