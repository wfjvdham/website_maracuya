In 2016 I moved to Colombia where I learned to speak [spanish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Raicuc2I2rM), to dance [bachata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfsSL8QRjrM), how to make [arepas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJu0gRFsBrs) and how to make a [jugo de maracuya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8gBDmKg5HU).

I also started giving classes about the R language, which I really enjoyed. Back in the Netherlands I continued giving the classes and extended the topics to other languages like `python` and `JavaScript`. 

This website I use to write a small blog when I discover something interesting and to provide a small overview of the courses I give:

# R

1. **Basics** starting point if you have few or zero experience with R. The basic concepts are explained here. 

    * Exploring data using the `ggplot2` and `dplyr` packages
    * Presenting the results in a reproduceble way using the `rmarkdown` package
    * Transforming data to a tidy format using the `tidy` package
    * Make calculations with times and dates using the `lubridate` package
    * Reading data from a file into R using the `readr` package
    * Connect to a database using the `DBI` package
    * An introduction into statistical models, a linear model and logistic regression
 
2. **ML** here more advanced techniques for modeling a data set are explained.

    * Cross validation 
    * Bootstrapping
    * Feature selection
    * Decision trees 
    * Random forests
    * Unsupervised learning
 
3. **Big Data** explanation of what is big data, hadoop MapReduce and spark and how to use it in combination with R. Introduction to the `sparklyr` package and cloudera virtual machines

4. **Advanced** here more advanced R topics are explained

    * Functional programming using the `purrr` package
    * Writing functions using tidy evaluation
    * Making a R package
    * Scraping information from an internet page using the `rvest` package
    * Combining R and python using `reticulate`

5. **Shiny** making interactive web pages using the `shiny` package

# python

Basic training for people without too much experience

  * Do efficient array operations using `NumPy`
  * Analyse DataFrames using `Pandas`
  * Explore data by making graphs using `Matplotlib`
    
# JavaScript

From basics to more advanced topics, focusing more on the back-end part of a website

  * How to make a website using JavaScript, HTML and CSS
  * How to make a backend using `nodejs`
  * How to connect your backand to a database using SQL or `MongoDB` 
  * How to handle asynchronous using callbacks or promises
  * How to test your website using `mocha`, `chai` and `sinon`
  * How to use the Object Oriented Programming paradigme in JavaScript
