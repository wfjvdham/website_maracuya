But Maracuya IT is my company for giving classes about R. I offer four courses at the moment:

1. R - Basics, for people who have zero or little experience with R. The basic about how to explore data, create graphics, do some simple statistical models and present the results is explained.
1. R - Machine Learning, this course focuses on using more complex statistical models in R. Random forrest, clustering and cross validation are explained.
1. R - Big Data, here I explain how to connect R to a cluster and do computations on large amounts of data using `sparklyr`.
1. R - Shiny, explains how to make interactive website and dashboards with R using `shiny`.

This website will contain examples of what you can do with the knowledge obtained in these courses.
