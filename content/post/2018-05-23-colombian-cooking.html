<p>Last December I had the opportunity to work with my friends from <a href="https://www.datasketch.co">randommonkey</a>. We made special about the <a href="http://especiales.datasketch.co/cocina-colombiana/">Colombian kitchen</a>. Part of this special was a Shiny application that can be used to search trough the Colombian recipes. Names, ingredient, region, complexity and the time required can be used to find your favorite one. After finding a recipe you can download the description.</p>
<p>So if you are interested in making some <em>Mojarras fritas</em> (and you know a little Spanish because the page is completely in Spanish) look <a href="http://especiales.datasketch.co/cocina-colombiana/recetas-colombianas.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The code of the application can be found <a href="https://github.com/wfjvdham/cocina-colombiana">here</a></p>
