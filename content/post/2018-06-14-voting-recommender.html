<p>In the Netherlands we have the <a href="https://stemwijzer.nl/">StemWijzer</a> a tool that calculates for which person to vote depending on your position on some statements. In Colombia they did not have such a tool yet. So I decided to make a <a href="https://maracuya.shinyapps.io/recommender/">template application</a> which can work for any country. The only thing you need is a list of statements where you can agree with or not. And a list of persons of which you know their positions on those statements. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/wfjvdham/congreso-recomendador">here</a></p>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The data required for this app needs to be formatted in a specific way. The part that can be edited by the user has 4 vectors.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The names of the persons where you want to compare the user with.</li>
<li>The statements where the user need to give their opinion about.</li>
<li>The themes to which these statements belong.</li>
<li>The positions on the different statements per person ranging from -2 till +2. Where -2 means completely disagree, 0 neatral and +2 completely agree. The length of this vector should be the length of the persons times the length of the statements so every person has a position for very statement.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>PERSONS &lt;- c( &quot;Andres&quot;, &quot;Diego&quot;, &quot;Camilo&quot;)
QUESTIONS &lt;- c(&quot;What is your position on question 1?&quot;,
               &quot;What is your position on question 2?&quot;,
               &quot;What is your position on question 3?&quot;)
THEMES &lt;- c(&quot;thema_1&quot;, &quot;thema_2&quot;, &quot;thema_2&quot;)
POSITIONS &lt;- c(2, -2, 1, -1, 0, 2, -1, -1, 2)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="user-input" class="section level2">
<h2>User Input</h2>
<p>Based on this data the app is generated. The user has to give two types of input to make a recommendation.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>His position on all the statements.</li>
<li>The themes that he thinks are extra important</li>
</ol>
<p>The questions that belong to the themes that are important according to the user have extra weight in the calculation.</p>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level2">
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Two types of results are given. A table with scores and the names of the persons. The score expresses the distance you have with an opinion of a person. Low scores means low distance and probably a good match. Using the <code>cmdscale()</code> function a plot is made that graphically shows the distance with the different persons. <code>cmdscale()</code> calculates the principal-components and takes the first two as axis of the plot. The position of the persons in the database and the user are then plotted as well.</p>
</div>
<div id="enjoy" class="section level2">
<h2>Enjoy!</h2>
<p>The interface is very bare at the moment but the functionality is there. If you have the data you can use this app to make a recommender for any election or any other problem where you want to compare opinions.</p>
